      <b>Internet</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Internet is the foremost important tool and the prominent resource
      that is being used by almost every person across the globe. It connects
      millions of computers, webpages, websites, and servers. Using the internet
      we can send emails, photos, videos, and messages to our loved ones. Or in
      other words, the Internet is a widespread interconnected network of
      computers and electronic devices(that support Internet). It creates a
      communication medium to share and get information online. If your device
      is connected to the Internet then only you will be able to access all the
      applications, websites, social media apps, and many more services. The
      Internet nowadays is considered the fastest medium for sending and
      receiving information.

      <b>Layout</b>
    </p>
    Is the universal design tool. To layout a page, means
    to use type and graphics and space, to create story, and voice, and
    engagement. Most layouts are static, nothing moves. They don't have to be;
    layouts can also move as they often do on the web, but for this course we'll
    focus on static layout and the reason is that everything we need to know can
    be learned there. Get the still page mastered and adding motion is a snap.
    When you think of layout, chances are you think of it as a mechanical thing.
    You have a page, which is a finite space, you have a fixed amount of
    material that go into that space, you may have a grid of columns and your
    job is to fill that space in a way that looks good.
